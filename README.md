Global Game Jam 2017 Side scroller- voice controlled game

GGJ 2017 theme was "Wave" - we created this game using *two*, yes TWO engines - Unity and Unreal, due to the fact that at current time Voice capture module for Unreal was not working properly.


In the game you control a monk with a pitch of your voice, either going down or up and omitting obstacles.
The main rules of the game are as follows:
* When you keep on saying "aaa" the monk goes upward
* When saying "uuu" the monk goes downward
* You have to omit any obstacles
* When the player is not "chanting" the monk travels downward toward its doom
* The overall benefit from playing the game is increasing one's lungs capacity!


###Team members:
* Dariusz Ruta – programming and system maintenance
* Filip Kwapisz – programming and design 
* Jakub Duchniewicz – programming and audio
* Mateusz Dragwa – 2D art and audio
* Michał Chmielewski – 2D art and UI
